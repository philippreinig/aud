* I will publish code incrementally during the term. This means the contents are subject to change!

* I'm grateful for any bug reports and improvements!

* Parts of the examples require installation of
    - **[GraphViz]** a set command line programs for [graph drawing] and
    - **[Batik]** a Java library for rendering Scalable Vector Graphics ([SVG])

    * Please refer to the **tutorials** for help with installation.

* You can use the [Makefiles] for building. Probably, importing the source to, e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse is more
  convenient.
