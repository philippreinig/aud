/** demos of graph algorithms<p>

    <ul>
    <li>{@link MyGraph} with {@link MyNode} and {@link MyEdge} implement a
    graph with all attributes that are required by algorithms/visualization</li>
    <li>{@link Traversal} provides a base class for implementation of various
    graph traversal algorithms (see subclasses)</li>
    <li>{@link TraversalExample} provides a test framework for graph
    traversals</li>
    <li>{@link GraphParser} reads graphs from text files (see {@code *.graph}
    files), alternatively you can build build graphs algorithmically such as
    {@link GraphP88}</li>
    </ul>
